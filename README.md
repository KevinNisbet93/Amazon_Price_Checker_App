# Web scraping - Amazon Price Checker Test

This is my first attempt after studying web scraping to access and extract data from online and use within my code. This app checks the price of an item on amazon and if the price is under a certain threshold, I will receive an email alerting me about the change and the application will quit. If the price has not changed, it will repeat and check again every 12 hours.
